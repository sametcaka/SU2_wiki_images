### Overview
Cygwin provides a unix-like environment on a Windows machine, and emulates some of the functionality of a linux distribution. Downloads and more information on Cygwin is available at http://www.cygwin.com/. To compile and run SU2 in Cygwin on a Windows machine, you will need to configure Cygwin with the appropriate packages (listed below), and then continue from within Cygwin as though you were using a linux machine. 
In summary, the steps are:

1. Download Cygwin installer
2. Install Cygwin, selecting the packages necessary to compile the source code.
3. Download the source code into a directory within cygwin/
4. Install SU2 according to the directions for the linux installation. 

### Notes on installing Cygwin for first-time or beginner Cygwin users
* It is often recommended to install in  a directory rather than the default C:\ location.
* The Cygwin shell will only be able to access folders that are within the cygwin\ directory; you will need to install and run SU2 inside the cygwin directory.

### Cygwin packages
At the package selection step, search for the following terms and select the associated packages to install. This list is a work-in-progress, and further packages may be required or desired.

#### Basic
* g++, gcc compiler
* python: install the packages under the python sub-heading
* cpp: all debug, pre-processor, regular expression packages.
