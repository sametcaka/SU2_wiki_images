The SU2 software suite requires several input files and produces several output files appropriate for each problem defined by the user. The [[Configuration File]] defines the problem of interest, and the various settings to be used by the software suite. A [[Mesh File]] contains the discretization of a physical domain of interest for a problem into a computational grid composed of unstructured elements (triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra, pyramids, or prisms). Optionally, a simulation may be resumed from a restart file if terminated at a specified number of iterations or after achieving a specified level of convergence in the residuals. These restart files contain all of the appropriate information regarding the solution state at the last recorded time step.
