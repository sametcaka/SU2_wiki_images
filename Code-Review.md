Code review is a process where changes to the SU2 repository are examined by other developers before being merged into the development branch

# Purpose
The goal of code review is to maintain correct code in a consistent style. Humans make mistakes, and code review is in place to catch mistakes before they become part of the main code suite. Good code is not just correct, but is also legible, and what is clear to the code author may not be clear to a reader of the code. Code review ensures that the code is understandable by at least two developers

# Philosophy
All developers and users (internal and external) are encouraged to participate in the code review process. The SU2 suite is a computational environment we are all working to maintain. When performing a code review, you should be asking yourself "Is this code that I want in our environment". A single developer may have written the bulk of the pull request, but once a change has been incorporated the whole community is in charge of future changes (maintenance, debugging, etc.)
