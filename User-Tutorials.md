Instead of writing a very detailed user manual, the approach has been taken to teach the various aspects of the SU2 code through a range of tutorials. These are numbered roughly in order of their complexity and how experienced with the code the user may need to be, noting that the more advanced tutorials may assume the user has already worked through the earlier ones. Each tutorial attempts to present new features of SU2 and contains explanations for the key configuration file options. More information on the exact learning goals of a tutorial can be seen at the beginning of each.
