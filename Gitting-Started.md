                <p>You can check out all of the development activity, and new developers are encouraged to log feature requests, questions, and bug reports through the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/su2code/SU2/issues">issue tracker</a>. Developers can have their code contributions integrated through GitHub as well.  For more information, keep reading! </p>

                <h4>Branching Model</h4>
                
                <p> This list describes the three types of branches on the SU2 repository. You'll want to pick the right one to work with, in order keep the merging process simple.</p>
                
                <ul>
                  <li> master -- stable, latest release and fixes </li>
                  <li> develop -- current development, generally the branch for you to start with </li>
                  <li> feature-* -- feature specific branches, check with the developer email list if you think this a better place to contribute </li>
                </ul>
                
                <div style="height:30px; width:100%"></div>
                
                
                <h4>Contributing Code</h4>
                
                <p> SU2 merges new code contributions through <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">pull requests</a>.  As a new developer, you'll want to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">fork</a> SU2 to your personal account.  This creates a clone of the whole SU2 repository, branches and all, inside your github account.  Generally you'll want to start from the develop branch, but you can check with the dev-list if you think it would be more appropriate to work on a feature branch.  </p>
                
                <p> You can push all of your working changes to your forked repository.  Once you're happy with these, and want to push them to the origin repository, submit a pull request for your branch.  Make sure to pull any new changes from the origin repository before submitting the pull request, so that the changes can be merged more simply.  The senior developers will check out the changes, make comments, ask for some edits.  Then when everything looks good, your changes will merge into the main development branch! </p>
