SU2 uses a simple format for the restart files. The SU2 solution format has the extension .dat, and the files are in readable ASCII format. After a header line with variable names, the solution (conservative variables) is provided at each vertex of the numerical grid, along with other meaningful quantities, such as Pressure or Mach number, and no information about the mesh elements or connectivity is included in the file. **Note: the global point index is provided at the beginning of each line, and the ordering of the points is (and must be kept) the same as in the mesh file.**

The restart files are used to restart the code from a previous solution and also to run the adjoint simulations, which require a flow solution as input. In order to run an adjoint simulation, the user must first change the name of the restart_flow.dat file to solution_flow.dat in the execution directory (these default file names can be adjusted in the config file). It is important to note that the adjoint solver will create a different adjoint restart file for each objective function, e.g. restart_adj_cd.dat.
