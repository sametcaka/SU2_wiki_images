This set of developer docs is meant to be a very brief overview of the SU2 project to help get new developers started. We include some practical guidelines for anyone who wants to help develop the code and also some information on the basic class hierarchy and code structure within SU2. We are in the process of generating more content/training material for developers as we speak, so stay tuned.

The full technical documentation of the code, explaining the structure and details of the source code for developers is generated through our Doxygen documentation. For information about how to use the suite, please take a look at the resources in the [[User Docs]].
